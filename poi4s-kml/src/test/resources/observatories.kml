                The Royal Observatory, Greenwich (known as the Royal Greenwich Observatory or RGO when the working institution
                moved from Greenwich to Herstmonceux after World War II) is an observatory situated on a hill in Greenwich Park,
                overlooking the River Thames. It played a major role in the history of astronomy and navigation, and is best
                known as the location of the prime meridian.<br/>
